Dijkstra's Algo:

finding shortest path, so it means optimization method, that means we can solve using greedy method.

1. Input:
      - Graph `G` with nodes `V` and edges `E`
      - Source node `S`
2. Output:
      - Shortest distance from `S` to every other node

3. Begin:
    a. Initialize a distance table `dist[]`:
          - Set `dist[S] = 0` (distance to source is 0)
          - Set `dist[u] = âˆž` for all other nodes `u`
    b. Create a priority queue `pq` (min-heap) and insert `(0, S)` (distance, node)
    c. Mark all nodes as unvisited.

4. While `pq` is not empty:
      a. Extract the node `u` with the smallest distance from `pq`
      b. Mark `u` as visited.
      c. For each unvisited neighbor `v` of `u`:
            - If `dist[u] + weight(u, v) < dist[v]`:
                - Update `dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)`
                - Add `(dist[v], v)` to `pq`

5. Return `dist[]`
