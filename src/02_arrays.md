**Arrays**

collection of similar data items.

It is a static representation of list. 
(you cannot increase the size, you cannot store more data than the given size, if you less data than the size of the array the space is wasted)
If we know exact size of the array then go for Array data structure. 
when you deal with unknown data size then array is not the suitable to use.

syntax: int a[5];

it means that array consists of integers data type of 5 items.

for int - 2 bytes
for float - 4 bytes
for char - 1 bytes


assigning:

int a[5];

a[0] = 1
a[1] = 2
a[2] = 3
a[3] = 4
a[4] = 5

or 

int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}


odd = a[i]%2==1
