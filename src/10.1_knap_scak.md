Knapsack Problem using the Greedy Method:

1. Input: 
      - Array of items, each with weight `w[i]` and value `v[i]`
      - Capacity of the knapsack `W`
2. Output: Maximum total value that can be accommodated in the knapsack

3. Begin:
    a. Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item: `ratio[i] = v[i] / w[i]`
    b. Sort items in descending order of `ratio[i]`

4. Initialize:
      - `currentWeight = 0` (tracks the weight in the knapsack)
      - `maxValue = 0` (tracks the total value in the knapsack)

5. For each item in sorted order:
      a. If `currentWeight + w[i] <= W`:
            - Add the full item to the knapsack
            - `currentWeight += w[i]`
            - `maxValue += v[i]`
      b. Else:
            - Add the fraction of the item that fits:
                  - `remainingWeight = W - currentWeight`
                  - `maxValue += remainingWeight * ratio[i]`
                  - Break the loop (knapsack is full)

6. Return `maxValue`
