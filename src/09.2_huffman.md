Huffman coding is a data compression technique.

1. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes of the Huffman tree.
   - Each node contains a character and its frequency.

2. For each character in the input:
   a. Create a leaf node for the character.
   b. Add the node to the priority queue.

3. While the priority queue has more than one node:
   a. Remove the two nodes with the lowest frequency from the queue (say, left and right).
   b. Create a new internal node with:
        i. Frequency = sum of the frequencies of the two nodes.
       ii. Left child = the first removed node.
      iii. Right child = the second removed node.
   c. Add this new node to the priority queue.

4. The remaining node in the queue is the root of the Huffman tree.

5. Traverse the Huffman tree to assign binary codes to each character:
   a. Start from the root.
   b. Assign '0' for left edges and '1' for right edges during traversal.
   c. At each leaf node, record the binary code for the corresponding character.

6. Return the binary codes and the Huffman tree.
